RFID Project
------------
### January 06 2018

This is my [Progress Report](https://github.com/gurusharma/RFID/blob/master/Guru%20progress%20report.docx) for week 10.

### January 05 2018
I was not able to find a 3D case for my RFID reader on any website, so I designed it myself and got it printed from the Tornoto Public Library. Priting 3D objects at public library is very cheap but you are allowed two hours maximum for each print job. You can find printing cost and other information at this [link](http://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/using-the-library/computer-services/innovation-spaces/3D-design-print.jsp)<br><br> I used the dimensions provided on manufacturers website to design my case. I have uploaded my design [file](https://github.com/gurusharma/RFID/blob/master/RFID%203D%20case/RFID%203D%20case.stl) in my repository. Here is how it looks!!!<br><br>

### Script
Hello my name is Guru Sharma and I am working on the RFID card reader for my project. The parts that arrived are RFID reader, RFID tags and the raspberry pi. The RFID reader module that I utilize, consists of two parts - one is RFID Reader and the other is RFID tag, with 12 digit character code in a coil. When RFID tag is placed near the RFID reader, it reads tag data serially. The transfer of data from Reader to Tag and Tag to Reader occurs with help of electromagnetic waves. For my project, I would be utilizing this technology to allow users to authenticate fast using RFID tags.

0s-10s: Opening and the parts that arived<br>
11s-20s: parts assembly and powering up sensor<br>
21s-30s: Demo of the working sensor<br>
### Week 7 - November 30, 2017
* Got all the sensors to work with my PCB board
* I started building voltage divider circuit for my sensor in order to connect my sensor with raspberry pi
### Tested LED blinking on my PCB board - November 30, 2017

### Completed soldering my PCB board - November 24, 2017
Now I am waiting for the other sensors to arrive which I will be hooking with my PCB board to read light, temperature and humidity readings

### Started working on PCB board - November 17, 2017
