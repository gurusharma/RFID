### Script
Hello my name is Guru Sharma and I am working on the RFID card reader for my project. The parts that arrived are RFID reader, RFID tags and the raspberry pi. The RFID reader module that I utilize, consists of two parts - one is RFID Reader and the other is RFID tag, with 12 digit character code in a coil. When RFID tag is placed near the RFID reader, it reads tag data serially. The transfer of data from Reader to Tag and Tag to Reader occurs with help of electromagnetic waves. For my project, I would be utilizing this technology to allow users to authenticate fast using RFID tags.

0s-10s: Opening and the parts that arived<br>
11s-20s: parts assembly and powering up sensor<br>
21s-30s: Demo of the working sensor<br>
### Week 7 - November 30, 2017
* Got all the sensors to work with my PCB board
* I started building voltage divider circuit for my sensor in order to connect my sensor with raspberry pi
